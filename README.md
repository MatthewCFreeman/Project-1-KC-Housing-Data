# Project-1-KC-Housing-Data
The first Flatiron Data Science Module ending project. This involved a normal data science workflow being used on a csv file containing data relating to housing in King County.

Project-1-Notebook.ipynb is a Jupyter Notebook file covering the workflow and investigation.

kc-house-data.csv is the main data set. This contains the data covering multiple variables on houses sold in King County, Washington.

King County Google Maps.png is an image taken from google maps of the King County area. This is only included here for use in the notebook investigation and visualisation.

The PDF is a PDF export of a powerpoint presentation not included here. The presentation is aimed at non-technical stakeholders, explaining the methods used and some useful results and statistics.

A blog covering how the location-related feature selection and visualisation was done can also be found at .... t.b.u.
